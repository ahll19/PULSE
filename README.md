# README
todo:
- [ ] make for loop in reading files use cases. mod 100 (or something) we should check ram usage, and same with timeout
- [ ] try CMI again. Or MI. Make all errors binary, and check if it is dependen on the register (maybe conditioned on the clock cycle, or something else)
- [ ] Research other predictor methods (check how good a predictor the register is, and maybe the register along with the clock cycle)
